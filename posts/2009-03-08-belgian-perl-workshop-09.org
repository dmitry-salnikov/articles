last weekend my co-workers and I went to the
[[http://conferences.mongueurs.net/bpw2009/][Belgian Perl Workshop 09]].
I attended the following presentations:

-  [[http://conferences.mongueurs.net/bpw2009/talk/1720][KiokuDB]], by
   nothingmuch. Slides are available
   [[http://www.iinteractive.com/kiokudb/talks/bpw2009.xul][here]]. We
   were able to talk with him during the afternoon, we might we use it
   at [[http://rtgi.fr][$work]].

-  [[http://conferences.mongueurs.net/bpw2009/talk/1740][Painless XSLT
   with Perl]], by andrew shitov. Was interesting, even if I don't do
   any XSLT anymore. Again, some ideas might be used for work.

-  [[http://conferences.mongueurs.net/bpw2009/talk/1792][What are you
   pretending to be ?]], by liz. That's a hell of a hack. The module is
   available on the
   [[http://search.cpan.org/~elizabeth/persona/][CPAN]].

-  [[http://conferences.mongueurs.net/bpw2009/event/473][Regular
   Expressions and Unicode Guru]], by abigail. Feel better to know that
   I'm not the only one suffering with unicode in Perl ;). Learn some
   stuff like how to create a custom character classe, etc.

-  [[http://conferences.mongueurs.net/bpw2009/event/474][Catalyst]], by
   matt trout. Ok, we're using Catalyst at work for our webservices. So
   we allready know about catalyst, but we were curious. And as i was
   hoping, we learn some nice tweaks. We discovered
   [[http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Model::Adaptor][Catalyst::Model::Adaptor]],
   so we don't have to do some horrible stuff in our Controller any
   more, and some other interesting stuff were put in this talk. And
   matt is a really good speaker, manage to keep an audiance amused and
   interested.

-  [[http://conferences.mongueurs.net/bpw2009/event/476][Catalyst &
   AWS]], by matt trout. Once again, a really good talk by matt. Some
   good advices, and a lot of fun.

We didn't stay long for the social event in the evening; we had booked a
hotel in bruxelles. But i'm glad that we were able to get to this perl
workshop, it was well-organised, good talks, meet nice people, and learn
some stuff. All in all, a good day :)
