First, no more [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_rarebit][welsh]].
Ever.

Even if Calais was not the easiest destination for every one, it was a
really fun and intersting two days. I met nice folks, had great
discussions and drink good beers.

   about the future of [[http://github.com/perldancer/dancer][Dancer]]
-  fun facts about time zone and unicode with
   [[http://twitter.com/maddingue][maddingue]],
   [[http://twitter.com/octoberequus][rgs]] and

   development
