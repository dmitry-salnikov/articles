  Ack is designed as a replacement for 99% of the uses of grep.

[[https://metacpan.org/module/App::Ack][Ack]] is a really nice tool for
searching your source code. It's faster than grep because he already
knows what you want : searching your sources files :)

By default it will not search in SCM files (.git, .svn, ...), backups
files (source.pl~, source.pl.bak, ...). You can specify what kind of
files you want (=--perl=, =--cc=, ...), make it match some regex with
=--match=, ...

And you can set some defaults configuration in a .ackrc file ! Mine
looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    --sort-files
    --color
    --context=1
    --follow
#+END_SRC

ack integration]].

Oh, and it's the only program with =--thpppt= option!
