When you install a module from the [[http://search.cpan.org][CPAN]], and
this module requires other modules, the cpan shell will ask you if you
want to install them. When you are installing
[[http://www.catalystframework.org/][Catalyst]], it may take a while,
and you may not want to spend your afternoon in front of the prompt
answering "yes" every 5 seconds.

The solution is to set the environment variable
*PERL\_MM\_USE\_DEFAULT*. Next time you want to install a big app:
=PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 cpan Catalyst KiokuDB= and your done.
