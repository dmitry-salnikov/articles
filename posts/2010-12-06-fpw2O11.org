I joined the organization team for the next French Perl Workshop, which
should take place in Paris in June. I'll help the existing team
(composed of Laurent Boivins, Sebastien DeSeille and
[[http://twitter.com/maddingue][maddingue]]) and also the newcomers
([[http://twitter.com/cmaussan][cmaussan]] and
[[http://github.com/eiro][eiro]]).

We've already decided to organize it in Paris, since last year it was in
[[http://journeesperl.fr/fpw2010/][Calais]], and the idea is to organize
once every two years in Paris. We don't have yet a venue and a date, but
we will try to keep you informed about this.

The main theme should be "Modern Perl", and we would like to reach a
wider audience than previous years: people who are not yet in the Perl
community, as well as some foreigners (hey, Paris is a beautiful city).

I'll try to communicate about our progress at least once a month, and
find reasons to motivate you to come! :)
