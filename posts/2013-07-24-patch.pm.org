Next week-end (from Friday, July 26 to Sunday, July 29), the French
[[http://mongueurs.pm/][Mongueurs]] are organizing the first
[[http://patch.pm/p0/][patch.pm]], a new hackathon around Perl.

If you can't attend the event, feel free to hop on /#mongueurs/, on
/irc.perl.org/, and join us to work on your favorite module! I'll be
working [[http://github.com/perldancer/Dancer2][Dancer2]] during the
week-end.

A huge thanks to the [[https://twitter.com/mongueurs_perl][French
Mongueurs]] (and especially [[https://twitter.com/elbeho][Laurent]]) for
organizing this one.
