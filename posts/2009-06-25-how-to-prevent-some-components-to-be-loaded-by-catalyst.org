Let's say you have a large
[[http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst][Catalyst]] application, with
a lot of compoments. When you deploy your application, or when you want
to test it while your developping, you may not want to have some of
thoses components loaded (you don't have all the dependencies, they are
incompatible, etc...). Catalyst use
[[http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Pluggable][Module::Pluggable]]
to load the components, so you can easily configure this. In your
application's configuration, add:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    setup_components:
      except:
        - MyApp::Model::AAAA
        - MyAPP::Model::BBBB::REST
        ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

Module::Pluggable have some other interesting features. You may have a
second Catalyst application, and want to use one or more components from
this one. You can easily do this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    setup_components:
      search_path:
        - MyApp
        - MyOtherApp::Model
#+END_EXAMPLE
