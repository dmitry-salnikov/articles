If you use DBIx::Class and want to see what the SQL generated looks
like, you can set the environment variable *DBIC\_TRACE*.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    % DBIC_TRACE=1 my_programme.pl
#+END_SRC

And all the SQL will be printed on *STDERR*.

If you give a filename to the variable, like this

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    % DBIC_TRACE="1=/tmp/sql.debug"
#+END_SRC

all the statements will be printed in this file.
