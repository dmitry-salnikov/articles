We ([[http://rtgi.fr][RTGI]]) have been working to update the
[[http://cpan-explorer.org][cpan-explorer]]. A new version will be
available this week, before YAPC::EU. Three new maps have been created,
using different informations than the previous one, and you will be able
to search and pinpoint the browsable maps.
