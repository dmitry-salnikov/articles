The 2nd and 3rd of October, will be held in Paris the Open Source
Developers Conference. The purpose of this conference is to gather
developers from various open source communities (Perl, Ruby, Python,
...) during two days.

It's still possible de submit a talk about the subject of your choice,
and it's important to note that this conference is free.

RTGI is proud to be one of the sponsor of this event :).
