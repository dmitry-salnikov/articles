This morning I saw
[[http://marcus.nordaaker.com/awesome-route-graph-with-mojoxroutesasgraph/][this
post]] from Marcus Ramberg about
[[http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MojoX::Routes::AsGraph][MojoX::Routes::AsGraph]].
I liked the idea. But as I Catalyst instead of Mojo, I thought I could
give a try and do the same thing for Catalyst dispatcher, and I've coded
CatalystX::Dispatcher::AsGraph. For the moment only private actions are
graphed.

You use it like this:
=perl bin/catalyst_graph_dispatcher.pl --appname Arkham --output routes.png=

You can create a simple script to output as text if you prefer:

#+BEGIN_SRC perl
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use strict;
    use CatalystX::Dispatcher::AsGraph;

    my $graph = CatalystX::Dispatcher::AsGraph->new_with_options();
    $graph->run;
    print $graph->graph->as_txt;
#+END_SRC

The code is on
[[http://git.lumberjaph.net/p5-catalystx-dispatcher-asgraph.git/][my git
server]] for the moment.

For thoses who are interested by visualization, I'll publish soon some
(at least I think) really nice visualisations about CPAN, Perl, and his
community, that we have created at [[http://rtgi.fr][$work]].
