([[http://search.cpan.org/~sukria/][sukria]]) released
[[http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Dancer][Dancer]] 1.130 this weekend.
Dancer is a small and nice web framework based on ruby's
[[http://www.sinatrarb.com/][sinatra]].

Dancer have few dependancies (and it doesn't depends anymore on CGI.pm).
The path dispatching is done using rules declared with HTTP methods
(get/post/put/delete), and they are mapped to a sub-routine which is
returned as the response to the request. Sessions are supported, and two
template engines (one of them is Template Toolkit) comes with the Core.
Dancer::Template::MicroTemplate is also available on CPAN if you need a
light template engine.

You can easily test it with a simple script

#+BEGIN_SRC perl
    #!/usr/bin/env perl
    use Dancer;

    get '/' => sub {
        return "dancer";
    };

    get '/:name' => sub {
        return params->{name} . " is dancing";
    };

    dance;
#+END_SRC

and execute this script, point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:3000,
and voila.

Dancer provides also a small helper to write a new application:
=dancer -a MyApplication=

If you create an application with this script, an *app.psgi* file will
be created. You can now execute =plackup --port 8080=

(which comes with [[http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Plack][Plack]] the
[[http://plackperl.org/][Perl Web Server]]) and test if everything works
fine: =curl http://localhost:8080=.

This release remove some components from the core and they are now
available as differents CPAN distributions. Two new keyword have also
been added, *header* and *prefix*.
