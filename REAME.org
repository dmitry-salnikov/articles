* Setup
  Ruby's [[http://bundler.io/][bundler]] is required to set up the blog. Follow the instructions:

  + =gem install bundler=
  + =bundler install=

* Work on the blog
  I don't really care about a clear history for the blog.

* Write an article
  Drafts should be in the *_drafts* folder.

* Publish
  Publishing the blog is easy, you just have to run =make publish= and the site will be generated and rsync'ed to the server.
