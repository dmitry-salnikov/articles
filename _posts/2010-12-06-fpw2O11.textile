I've joined the organisation team for the next French Perl Workshop, which sould take place in Paris, sometimes in June. I'll help the existing team (composed of Laurent Boivins, Sebastien DeSeille and "maddingue":http://twitter.com/#!/maddingue) and also the new comers ("cmaussan":http://twitter.com/cmaussan and "eiro":https://github.com/eiro).

We've already decided to organise it in Paris, since these year it was in Calais, and the idea is to organize once every two years in Paris. We don't have yet a venue and a date, but we will try to keep you informed about this.

The main theme should be "Modern Perl", and we would like to reach a wider audience than previous years: people who are not in the Perl community, but also some foreigners (hey, Paris is a beautiful city).  

I'll try to communicate about our progress at least once a month, and find a reason to motivate you to come! :)
