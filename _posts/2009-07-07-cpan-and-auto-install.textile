title: CPAN and auto-install
---

When you install a module from the "CPAN":http://search.cpan.org, and this module requires other modules, the cpan shell will ask you if you want to install them. When you are installing "Catalyst":http://www.catalystframework.org/, it may take a while, and you may not want to spend your afternoon in front of the prompt answering "yes" every 5 seconds.

The solution is to set the environment variable *PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT*. Next time you want to install a big app:

bc. PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 cpan Catalyst KiokuDB

and your done.
