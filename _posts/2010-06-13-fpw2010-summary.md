First, no more [welsh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_rarebit). Ever.

Even if Calais was not the easiest destination for every one, it was a really fun and intersting two days. I met nice folks, had great discussions and drink good beers.

For those who missed this workshop, a short summary for you:

 * had excellent discussions with [sukria](http://www.sukria.net/fr/) about the future of [Dancer](http://github.com/sukria/dancer)
 * fun facts about time zone and unicode with [maddingue](http://twitter.com/maddingue), [rgs](http://twitter.com/octoberequus) and [fperrad](http://github.com/fperrad)
 * interesting chat with fperrad about lua and parrot
 * convinced more people that Plack *is* the future for Perl Web development
 * beers, and more beers with sukria, jerome, [Arnaud](http://twitter.com/ephoz), rgs, [Camille](http://twitter.com/cmaussan) and [Stephane](http://twitter.com/straux).
 * talked with [Marc](http://www.tinybox.net/) about Plack, Dancer, and other stuff
