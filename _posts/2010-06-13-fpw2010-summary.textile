First, no more "welsh":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_rarebit. Ever.

Even if Calais was not the easiest destination for every one, it was a really fun and intersting two days. I met nice folks, had great discussions and drink good beers.

For those who missed this workshop, a short summary for you:

 * had excellent discussions with "sukria":http://www.sukria.net/fr/ about the future of "Dancer":http://github.com/sukria/dancer
 * fun facts about time zone and unicode with "maddingue":http://twitter.com/maddingue, "rgs":http://twitter.com/octoberequus and "fperrad":http://github.com/fperrad
 * interesting chat with fperrad about lua and parrot
 * convinced more people that Plack *is* the future for Perl Web development
 * beers, and more beers with sukria, jerome, "arnaud":http://twitter.com/ephoz, rgs, "camille":http://twitter.com/cmaussan and "stephane":http://twitter.com/straux.
