Next week-end (from Friday, July 26 to Sunday, July 29), the French [Mongueurs](http://mongueurs.pm/) are organizing the first [patch.pm](http://patch.pm/p0/), a new hackathon around Perl.

If you can't attend the event, feel free to hop on *#mongueurs*, on *irc.perl.org*, and join us to work on your favorite module! I'll be working [Dancer2](http://github.com/perldancer/Dancer2) during the week-end.

A huge thanks to the [French Mongueurs](https://twitter.com/mongueurs_perl) (and especially [Laurent](https://twitter.com/elbeho)) for organizing this one.
