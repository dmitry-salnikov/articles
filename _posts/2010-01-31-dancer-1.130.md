summary: In which I announce Dancer 1.130
title: Dancer 1.130
---

[Alexis](http://www.sukria.net/) ([sukria](http://search.cpan.org/~sukria/)) released [Dancer](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Dancer) 1.130 this weekend. Dancer is a small and nice web framework based on ruby's [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/).

Dancer have few dependancies (and it doesn't depends anymore on CGI.pm). The path dispatching is done using rules declared with HTTP methods (get/post/put/delete), and they are mapped to a sub-routine which is returned as the response to the request. Sessions are supported, and two template engines (one of them is Template Toolkit) comes with the Core. Dancer::Template::MicroTemplate is also available on CPAN if you need a light template engine.

You can easily test it with a simple script

{% highlight perl %}
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use Dancer;

get '/' => sub {
    return "dancer";
};

get '/:name' => sub {
    return params->{name} . " is dancing";
};

dance;
{% endhighlight %}

and execute this script, point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:3000, and voila.

Dancer provides also a small helper to write a new application: `dancer -a MyApplication`

If you create an application with this script, an **app.psgi** file will be created. You can now execute `plackup --port 8080`

(which comes with [Plack](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Plack) the [Perl Web Server](http://plackperl.org/)) and test if everything works fine: `curl http://localhost:8080`.

This release remove some components from the core and they are now available as differents CPAN distributions. Two new keyword have also been added, **header** and **prefix**.
