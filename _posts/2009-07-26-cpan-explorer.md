title: CPAN Explorer
---

We ([RTGI](http://rtgi.fr)) have been working to update the [cpan-explorer](http://cpan-explorer.org). A new version will be available this week, before YAPC::EU. Three new maps have been created, using different informations than the previous one, and you will be able to search and pinpoint the browsable maps.
