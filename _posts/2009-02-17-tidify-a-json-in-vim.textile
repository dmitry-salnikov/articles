title: tidify a json in vim

If you have to edit json files from vim, you may want to make them more readable, here is how you can do this:

start by installing the JSON::XS perl module from the CPAN

{% highlight perl %}
sudo cpan JSON::XS
{% endhighlight %}

then, edit your .vimrc and add the following

{% highlight vim %}
map <leader>jt  <Esc>:%!json_xs -f json -t json-pretty<CR>
{% endhighlight %}

now while editing a json file, you can hit *,jt* (or whatever your leader is set to) and tidify a json.
