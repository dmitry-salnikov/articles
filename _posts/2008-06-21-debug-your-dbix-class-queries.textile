title: debug your DBIx::Class queries

If you use DBIx::Class and you want to see what the SQL generated looks like, you can set the environment variable DBIC_TRACE.

{% highlight vim %}
% DBIC_TRACE=1 my_programme.pl
{% endhighlight %}

And all the SQL will be printed on STDERR.

If you give a filename to the variable, like this

{% highlight vim %}
% DBIC_TRACE="1=/tmp/sql.debug"
{% endhighlight %}

all the statements will be printed in this file.
