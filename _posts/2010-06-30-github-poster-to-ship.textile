I've finally found a printer that can do international shipping for reasonable costs. The price will be 65â‚¬, and a paypal account will be setup soon.

So, if you're interested by a poster in A1 size, [send me a mail](/contact/). I'll need at least 15 persons to be able to do this. So contact me, and I will keep you informed.
