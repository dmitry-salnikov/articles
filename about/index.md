# about

I'm a Site Reliability Engineer, living in Berkeley and working at [Twitter](https://twitter.com). At the moment I'm especially interested in functional programming and operating systems.

I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/franckcuny) and [GitHub](https://github.com/franckcuny). You can email me at [franckcuny@gmail.com](mailto:franckcuny@gmail.com).

I'm a proud member of [Paris.pm](http://paris).
