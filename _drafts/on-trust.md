summary: In which I talk about trust
---

I've a problem: most people I know (friends, co-worker, my mum) don't trust me. Most of the time they second guess, doubt what I say. To be honest I find that really irritating. I'm sure it tells more about myself more than anything else, since trust is something you earn, but anyway.

A few weeks ago I was watching Russ Olsen's talk "(To The Moon)[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Sso4HtvJsw]". Take one hour to watch it, it's one of the most inspiring talk I've seen. Toward the end of the presentation, he tells the story of Neil Armstrong, and how he had to take a quick decision to make the capsule fly toward instead of down, to avoid landing in a crater. It would have been a perfect time for all the engineers in the command center to say "Hey Neil, you shouldn't do that" or "You should do it that way". But no, no one said anything, they trusted the person who was in charge.

Still, I'm lucky to have a great co-worker who trust me. When we work on something, he trusts that if I don't know or understand something, I'll ask him. This is definitely a better way to work.
