I'm working in a small team, since it's only me and Hachi.  We've been working together for about 8 months now, and we've developed an interesting way to work.  Our projects can be differents, it can be coding, experimeneting tools, deploying them, build systems around tools, etc.

## Setup

What we try to do during the afternoon, is to find an available meeting room with either a projector or a TV connected to a Mac Mini.  One of us "drive" the session, and either project on the wall or on the TV via AirPlay.  Since we're using our laptop and a huge external screen, it's easy for us to switch who's leading.  We tend to prefer using the projector, because that way we can walk to the wall and point stuff on it.

Our current project include a lot of coding, and we've introduced a new pattern.  What we will do is to code on something during the morning, on our own, and in the afternoon we will review our different changes between merging them.  It's a more effective code review that using a tool like Gerrit, because you don't have to submit something and wait for input, you'll get it immediatly, and if you have to update your change, we do it together, that way we don't have to resubmit and wait for more input.

So far it has been very effective for us.  We're able to work quickly, and it's usually fun.
