Last week I've re-installed my current Linode server.  Since I wanted
to limit the downtime, I prepared everything on a local VM using
VirtualBox.

One of the goal was to automate as much as possible this box (and in
the process, learn a few things) I also went to use chef.

This box host a few things : Jenkins, Phabricator, ...

Was easy
