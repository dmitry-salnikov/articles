Until a few years ago I was a vi user. One of my then co-worker was a heavy Emacs user and I used to make fun of him.

Like many developers, I was obsessed with my configuration files, trying to improve.

Now I don't care. I don't need the name of the git branch in my prompt. I almost never use the git CLI anymore, or tools like tig, I just rely on magit to give me all the information I need, to browse the changes, or to commit my work.

I've stopped using zsh, either I'm in eshell, or in bash. Since I'm using both of them, instead of having a heavy and complex configuration for it, I just use bash without any extras. My bashrc only add a few things to the path and export a few environment variables needed by some tools.
