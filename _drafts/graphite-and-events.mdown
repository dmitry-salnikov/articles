title: Where we talk about graphing events in Graphite

Graphite is thea nice tool.

curl http://localhost:8090/events/ -d '{"what": "deploy_stage", "tags" : "deploy,stage"}'

then by going to http://g.lumberjaph.net/graphlot/?&from=-15minute&until=-0hour&target=collectdlumberjaph_net.memory.memory-used&events=deploy# you can do correlation.
