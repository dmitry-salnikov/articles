Nothing exciting to write about so I'll share a prank I did a few years ago (because I'm kinda proud of this one).

To protect the innocent, I'll change the name.

I was working at a company, let's say LF.  One of my colleague, we will call him NG, when writing, was *always* looking at his keyboard.  Some time he would type for a few minutes, and then look at the screen and realize he was typing in the wrong window, or that it was full of typo.  This really bugged me, because I know that he had typed for years, but I was not sure if he was looking at his keyboard because he needs to, or just because his head was too heavy to look at the screen.

So one day, during a break. while everybody except the admin (let's call him GM) were away, I decided to conduct an experiment.

The french keyboard use the AZERTY layout.  NG uses Emacs as his editor, where the 'x' key is *really* important (because of 'Meta-x').  He also uses a laptop, connected to an external monitor and with an external keyboard.  So I decided to swap the 'x' and the 'z' letter on the external keyboard, by switching the caps.  The actual 'x' and 'z' are still at the same place, only the label on the key is switched.
