I'm French and moved to the Bay Area in 2011. I work as a software developer in [Say Media](http://saymedia.com)'s operations team.

At the moment I'm especially interested in functional programming. When I have time to code for myself, I do it mostly with [Clojure](http://clojure.org) and [Racket](http://racket-lang.org). Recently I've also decided to start learning Haskell.

Among the other things that are interesting to me, you'll find network social analysis, web technologies in general and [Perl](http://perl.org)

I'm a proud member of [Paris.pm](http://paris).
